# Glowlytics is a data-driven intelligence project focused on analyzing Amazon face wash product listings. Using advanced data cleaning, labeling, and enrichment techniques, Glowlytics extracts meaningful insights from raw product data — including prices, reviews, ingredients, and marketing keywords.

It categorizes products by price range (Budget, Mid-Range, Premium), generates automatic skincare tags (like Anti-Acne, Hydrating, For Men), and creates a structured dataset that can be used by:

* D2C skincare brands to identify gaps in the market

* Marketers and analysts to monitor price, popularity, and review trends

* Researchers exploring consumer behavior in personal care

*E-commerce startups for competitor tracking or recommendation systems

Glowlytics turns messy e-commerce data into clear, actionable skincare insights — helping brands and platforms make smarter product and marketing decisions.
